Submitted by: **Michael Ly**

Time spent: **~3** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [+] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [+] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [+] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [+] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [+] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [+] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [-] User loses the game after an incorrect guess (only loses after 3 mistakes optional feature)

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [+] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [+] More than 4 functional game buttons

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
<br/> A challenge when doing this prework was relearning and using javascript, css, and html. Some of the syntax in each of these is hard to remember
if you have not used it in a while. For example, when trying to get the timer to work, I struggled to try to get the correct syntax in javascript to 
print the timer to the screen. For the css colors of the buttons, some colors are not innately a thing (ex. light orange). Using html after a long time
of not using it was a bit of a struggle as well. Usage of p, /p versus h1, /h1, indetation of the words, the syntax of adding the id, onclick, etc, 
and understanding the code that was already given to us was overwhelming at first. All these cases were pretty easily solved utilizing websites or 
reading a little closer to the tutorial we were given. When in doubt, Google is an extrememly powerful resource, but we must always be careful in how
we utilize it.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
<br/> In my history of doing anything dealing with web-development, most backend things have been dealt with beforehand leaving me to do the actual page
with its functionality. I want to know how does one setup the webserver, how is it secured, how is it optimized, etc. These are things that I believe are
usually very important to be aware of when developing a product. Other questions I have include how does the browser deal with different devices with
different specifications, what are big limitations on projects like these now, what is the load limit of a webpage dependant on, etc.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
<br/> If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would probably spend time doing a few things. Firstly, I would probably try to implement the
rest of the optional features. Having different tones would be really cool, but I do not exactly have a ton of time to devote to it. The images/different
styling of the page is something I would definetly do with more time. As of right now, I believe I have made something presentable, but by no means a final
product. It would need to go through a lot more thought and attention to detail for it to get there. Lastly, I would likely try and make many of the settings
changable by user choice. For example, generating how many buttons, how fast should the clues be, how long should the timer be are all things that I want to do.
